## Sample Register Narrative 2021-06-20

This narrative is a markdown file that should accompany each update
to a register to give the visitor changelog information and a basic
background to the register.

This Register is just a sample to check that the project works.
You can disable this register by changing its `config.json` so
that the framework ignores it.

Candidate update:

1. The term `4` has been added.
2. A new propoerty `japanese` has been added to each term.
