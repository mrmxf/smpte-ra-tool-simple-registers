## Sample Register Narrative 2021-0618

This narrative is a markdown file that should accompany each update
to a register to give the visitor changelog information and a basic
background to the register.

This Register is just a sample to check that the project works.
You can disable this register by changing its `config.json` so
that the framework ignores it.

Status of the sample register:

* `current` version of the register is the reference
* `previous` version of the register demonstrates that `current` has had a new term added
* `candidate` version of the register demonstrates that a new term will be added **and**
  there have been new optional properties added to each term
