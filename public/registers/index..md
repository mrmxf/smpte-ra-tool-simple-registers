# SMPTE Simple Registers

This tool provides access to SMPTE's simple XML & JSON registers.
Each register is controlled by a different SMPTE document and
rules for its update and management are specific to that
register.

To add a new register, please contact [SMPTE Standards](https://www.smpte.org/about/contact_us)
about starting a new project or take a look at the Standards Manuals and guidelines
on the [SMPTE website](https://smpte.org)
