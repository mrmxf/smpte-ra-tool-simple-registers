# SMPTE Simple Registers

This section of the website deals with simple flattened registers.
These might be controlled vocabularies, lookup values, terms for
use in other standards.

Each simple register can be downloaded in its native form (typically json or xml)
and has a control document that defines the semantics and structure of the tersm.
Most registers will have a schema and some registers will have custom viewers
written and maintained by the proponents of the register to help you
navigate the data.

The list of registers in this category is available from the page menu.
